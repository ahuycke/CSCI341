In this folder, there are quite a few files, so here is an explanation of the purpose behind each one
that was created

1. simulator.py 
contains the code that tests a cache on the given test file. Additionally, it contains
some code that was commented out. This code generated hit rates for all possible cache configurations.
If you want to run my program, this is the file that you should be executing. For reference, I
executed it with python 3.10.

2. cache.py 
contains the class implementation for a cache. This class initializes the cache as a 2d list
and contains methods that allow items to be inserted into a cache using different replacement schemes.

3. cache_performance.csv
has hit rate data for all possible cache configurations

4. Cache Recommendations (pdf)
contains plots of data collected and my personal reccomendations for cache design
